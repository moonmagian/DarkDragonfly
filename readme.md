The RedDragonFly aquired the dark power.

She decides to save the world, which is flooded by the light.

If you don't know who she is, leave, this place is not for you.

But if you `request` her, with the artifact of `geopy`.

You shall get the salvation.

Alas, you are from another world, or another time?

Look inside the blessed one, thou shall find your salvation.
